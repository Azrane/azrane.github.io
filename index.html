				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h3>2023-05-30</h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				I go by Azrane online. I have some socials, my music is on SoundCloud and all 
				your usual streaming places. And I'm a washed-up, previously-aspiring web developer 
				that got left in the dust.
			</p>
			<p>
				While I don't know the difference between SASS and SCSS or React and Angular, I get 
				by making little things that help me out using my prefered medium: the web browser. 
				Which, btw, holy shit! These days, developer tools remove all the hard work. I would 
				have saved <em>so many hours</em> when I was a teenager.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm still a fan of properly-formatted, hand-coded HTML, though. If you're like me, 
				go ahead and view the source code of this page to feel the fuzzies. Don't bother 
				coming at me with the <em>spaces vs. tabs</em> nonsense, though. I'm too old for 
				that these days.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until I get my projects in order, there's a link up to my blog that I don't post to. 
				And the Mozilla Developer Network has been crucial in learning that everything I 
				learned previously is now a lie and doesn't apply to the semantic web. So there's a 
				link to that too, for me.
